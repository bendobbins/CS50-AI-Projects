# CS50-AI-Projects
Completed projects from CS50's Artificial Intelligence course: https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2020/. Short description of each project below.

## Week 0

### Degrees

Given CSV files with names of movie stars and the movies they starred in, find the degrees of connection between any two actors listed in the CSV files (connections being actors/actresses that starred in the same movie).

### Tic-Tac-Toe

Using the minimax algorithm, create an AI that will always win or draw tic-tac-toe games, depending on how well the user plays.

## Week 1

### Knights

Create an AI to play the game *Knights and Knaves* in which characters say one sentence each and the player must determine whether each character is a knight or a knave (telling the truth or lying).

### Minesweeper

Create an AI to play the game *Minesweeper*. AI uses information it discovers about what mines could be in which squares to make educated guesses about what square to choose next.

## Week 2

### PageRank

Create an AI to determine the most important webpages in a series of webpages. In simple terms, important webpages are ranked by how many other webpages link to them. The importance of the webpages linking to the page in question is also taken into consideration.

### Heredity

Create an AI to determine the probability that a child inherits certain genes or traits from their parents based on the likelihood of those genes/traits being passed on in specific scenarios.

## Week 3

### Crossword

An AI that creates crossword puzzles given words for the puzzle and a structure for the puzzle.

## Week 4

### Shopping

Based on previous consumer data, create an AI to determine whether users will be more likely to buy a specific product given specific conditions.

### Nim

An AI that trains itself to play the game *Nim* by playing 10000 games against itself, then plays against the user.

## Week 5

### Traffic

Create a neural network that, once trained for what different traffic signs look like, can recognize those traffic signs in pictures with above 90% accuracy.

## Week 6

### Parser

An AI that parses an English sentence and breaks it down into different parts. The goal being to determine if the sentence is grammatically correct or not based on which grammar is where in the sentence.

### Questions

An AI that can answer questions from the user by returning the best answer from Wikipedia files included in the project directory.
